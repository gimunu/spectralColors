spectralColors
==============

Python utility to calculate the color of physical samples with the spectra obtained from first principles calculations.

The suite at the moment is composed of a single tool 'color.py' that calculates the color from a given spectral density.
The functionality of color.py are partially overlapping with colormath (http://code.google.com/p/python-colormath/).


Another tool that calculates the spectral density from the molecular polarizability is soon to come.
