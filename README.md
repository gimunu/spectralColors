spectralColors
==============

Python utility to calculate the color of physical samples with the spectra obtained from first principles calculations.

The suite is at the moment composed of a single tool that calculates the color from a given spectral density.

Another tool that calculates the spectral density from the molecular polarizability calculates is soon to come.
